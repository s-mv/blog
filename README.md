# Welcome to my blog's README!

This blog was created using Jekyll, which is an awesome static site generator (that probably everyone knows about at this point)! It really helps that such tools exist, so I can focus on being creative rather than wasting my time designing pages.

TODO: Theme switching.

I plan to cross-post to other sites too, but that can wait for now!
